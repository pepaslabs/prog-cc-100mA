- add a reset button
- add a power switch?
- increase font size of + and - symbols on power plugs
- add diode on the output?
- create a version with built-in optoisolators?  and built-in FTDI/USB?
- create a version which uses rotary encoders for manual control via DAC?
- characterize the step-change response
- characterize the tempco of the unit
- try a variant with better resistors
- try a variant with all 5% resistors?
- move away from semi-colon as deliminator.  use newlines.
- add room for a heatsink?
- add circuitry to achieve true zero output?  a transistor to pull down a line or a trim pot to adjust the zero.
- redesign this board to use a single (low offset) opamp (e.g. OPO7)
